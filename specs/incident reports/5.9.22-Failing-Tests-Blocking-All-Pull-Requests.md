# Incident: Failing Tests Blocking all Pull Requests
* Date of Last Significant Update: [2022-06-06]

## Description of Incident
When we migrated the bullet journal to the new repository and reran the CI/CD pipeline, we discovered that some of the tests were failing. Unsure why, we created an issue to
address this and assigned it to Harry (Kaiyuan) for our first sprint. Unfortunately we were all impacted by midterms and the issue was neglected until Sunday when we realized
that it was blocking every pull request from merging. Sasha discovered that the failing tests were hard-coded to the month of June (when the tests were written a year ago by
the previous team).


## Resolution
A hotfix was pushed to main that changed the tests to now be hard-coded to May (the current month) that now unblocks the testing aspect of code review, albeit temporarily.


## Follow-up Actions
Obviously, the tests should not be hard-coded to any specific month. We have added a new issue to fix this problem more permanently so the tests work for more than 1 month
a year. That may be through mocking or some other solution.

[2022-05-31] The hard-coded month has been replaced with the current month, thus tests will not break in the future.
